Encountered a ton of issues with the code, my python environemnt and also with OpenCV

All Jupyter environments failed, idk why. Tried restarting all kernels, to no avail.

Created a Conda Environment, which finally allowed me access to Jupyter Lab, but tensorflow would not install, which I had to do manually via the Ananconda navigator.

OpenCV created most the issues. Implemented some fixes recommended to me on Stack Overflow, because of which I ended up uninstalling opecv-contrib-headless. This fixed the first error, but 
the imshow() error stil prevailed.

I saved the model and ended up abandoning the Anaconda Environment. Ran the training loop on VSCode.

OpenCV woudnt work on VSCode either. Troubleshooting took me a long time. Had to create a new Conda environment(again), into which I imported the model and was succesfully able to 
open and the VideoCapture() and imshow() functions successfully.

The Face detector works well, but I wish it was more accurate. It most probably suffers from overfitting, which would not have happened if I had a larger training dataset, which was around 10 photohraphs of mine multiplied 
3 times by the augmentor(Albumentations).
